"""Re-measure the interop matrix and the a2a-card-sign-v01 corpus against whatever SDK versions are installed now,
and say what moved since the frozen run of 2026-10-01.

Run after matrix.py (which writes out/results.json for the installed versions):
    python3 watch.py            writes out/watch_report.md and out/watch_state.json

What it reports:
  1. the versions measured (a2a-sdk, @a2a-js/sdk, a2a-go commit)
  2. every matrix cell that differs from results_20261001.json, and the section 8.4.1 example per SDK
  3. for the signed corpus, which reading each SDK's verifier follows today: the set of vectors an SDK accepts is
     compared with the set each reading accepts (rule-1-as-written, prune-empty, served-as-is); "none" means the
     SDK follows no single reading on these cards.
     2026-10-13: the headline is measured on s0 and s1 only, the groups the 2026-10-01 baseline had. From 2026-10-02
     the corpus also carries s2 to s4, whose vectors list readings of other axes (unknown fields, dual names), so a
     comparison over the whole corpus matched no reading and the watch reported "none" for every SDK from then on.
     Each group is now also classified on its own, against the readings that group's vectors list
It decides nothing about which reading is right; that is a2aproject/A2A#2122.
