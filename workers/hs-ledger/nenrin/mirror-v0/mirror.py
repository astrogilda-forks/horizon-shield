nenrin-mirror-v0: hold a copy of the evidence yourself.

An anchor proves that bytes with a digest existed by a block. It does not keep the bytes. If every copy of
the bytes disappears (this ledger, its intake, this repository, the operator itself), the anchor still proves
that something existed and nobody can say what. Integrity is not availability. The answer is not a promise by
the operator; it is copies held by people who are not the operator, each checkable against the anchors alone.

This file is the copy. Standard library only, one directory, every file named by what it is:

    <dir>/ledger/<n>.json    the ledger entry as served (claim_sha256, ots_status, bitcoin_block, record_canonical)
    <dir>/ledger/<n>.raw     the claim bytes as served (?format=raw); sha256 must equal claim_sha256
    <dir>/ledger/<n>.ots     the OpenTimestamps proof bytes for the entry
    <dir>/objects/<sha256>   every record a batch entry points to by bytes_url, stored under the digest the batch names it by:
                             sha256 of the bytes for agreements and executions; for a contract, contract_sha256 (sha256 over
                             "a2a-contract-v0\n" plus the canonical record without its signatures, the digest both parties sign),
                             which stays the same whether one or both signatures are present. verify checks each by its rule.
    <dir>/manifest.json      what was fetched, what verified, what did not, and the sha256 of this manifest

Two digests are printed and stored, and they answer two different questions:
    manifest sha256   the digest of this file's bytes. It includes mirrored_at, so two honest mirrors of identical
                      evidence always differ here, by construction. It identifies this copy, not the evidence.
    content_sha256    sha256 over the canonical manifest with mirrored_at, content_sha256 and entries_sha256 removed.
                      Two mirrors that fetched identical evidence (same entries, same anchor states, same objects,
                      same problems) share it exactly; a difference is a real diff, not the clock.
    entries_sha256    sha256 over the canonical entries list alone (the range), for a quick compare when only the
                      ledger part is in question.
"say I hold a mirror" means: post content_sha256 and the range. (2026-09-26, finding by the second mirror holder.)

    python3 mirror.py pull   --dir ./nenrin-mirror              # fetch or resume; re-verifies what is already there
    python3 mirror.py verify --dir ./nenrin-mirror              # offline: every raw against its claim, every object against its name
    python3 mirror.py diff   ./nenrin-mirror ../someone-elses   # what one holds that the other lacks, and any bytes that differ

What a mirror establishes: that these bytes, with these digests, were obtainable at this time, and that anyone
holding this directory can recompute every digest without the network. What it does not: that the ledger's
claims are true, that the anchors are valid (verify the .ots yourself against Bitcoin headers), or that this
copy is complete beyond what manifest.json lists. Two mirrors that diff clean are two independent copies; a
mirror whose verify fails names the exact file, and that file is the finding.
